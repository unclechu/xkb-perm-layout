xkb-perm-layout
===============

Daemon that resets current keyboard layout when another window is focused.

I implemented logic of this tool to another my own more complex tool:
[`xlib-keys-hack`](https://github.com/unclechu/xlib-keys-hack).

Build
-----

```bash
$ make
```

Run (as daemon)
---------------

```bash
$ ./build/xkb-perm-layout
```
